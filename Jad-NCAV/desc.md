## Introduction

## Original Trading Strategy

The net current asset value (NCAV/MV) strategy is a famous approach popularized by Benjamin Graham, the father of security analysis, from the 1930s to 1956. Per-share NCAV, as defined by Graham (Graham and Dodd (1934), Graham (1976)), is the balance sheet current assets minus all the firmâ€™s (current and long-term) liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding. Long-term assets (e.g., intangible assets and fixed assets) values are not counted.

Graham found that companies satisfying the NCAV/MV strategy were often priced at significant discounts to estimates of the value that stockholders could receive in the event of the actual sale or liquidation of the entire corporation. Thus, the NCAV/MV rule not only protects capital from significant permanent loss but also generates a portfolio of stocks with excellent prospects for an advance in price.

## Fundamental Reason

The NCAV rule forms portfolios filled with stocks with market capitalization lower than the amount of cash plus inventories they own. Many of these stocks are priced cheaply because the companies are in distress and might eventually go bankrupt. However, the remaining stocks bought at an extreme discount statistically gain more, leading to highly positive overall portfolio returns.

## Possible Modifications and Enhancements

### i. Market and Holding Period Adjustments

- Transition from the London Exchange to the US stock market to align with a more familiar and larger market.
- Consider alternative holding periods, allowing flexibility beyond the original one-year timeframe.

### ii. Sector Focus

- Introduce a sector-specific approach to enhance strategy focus.
- Explore the possibility of using ETFs.

### iii. Risk Management

- Implement stop-loss or trailing stop orders to manage downside risk.
- Protect against significant losses during adverse market conditions.
- Preserve capital and reduce drawdowns.

### iv. Dynamic Weighting

- Shift from equal weighting to dynamic weighting for portfolio allocation.
- Factors to consider for dynamic weighting:
  - **Market conditions**: Adjust weights based on overall market sentiment or economic indicators.
  - **Volatility**: Implement weighting adjustments to mitigate risks during periods of high volatility.
  - **Company Size**: Explore the possibility of dynamically adjusting weights based on company size.
