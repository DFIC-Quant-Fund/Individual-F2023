## Overview

Pairs trading is a market-neutral trading strategy that involves taking a long position in one asset while simultaneously taking a short position in another related or correlated asset. The goal of pairs trading is to profit from the relative price movements between the two assets, irrespective of the direction of the overall market.

## Hypothesis

Successful pairs trading relies on identifying assets that have a high historical correlation. Moreover, cointegration ensures that the relationship between the assets is stable over the long term, even if short-term divergences occur. Additionally, pairs trading assists in reducing trading risks brought on by movements in the marketâ€™s direction. Even if one underperforms, the other can compensate for the losses.
